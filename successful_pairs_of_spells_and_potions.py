# You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.
# You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.
# Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.
