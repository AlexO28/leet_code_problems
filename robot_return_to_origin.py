# There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.
# You are given a string moves that represents the move sequence of the robot where moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are 'R' (right), 'L' (left), 'U' (up), and 'D' (down).
# Return true if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or false otherwise.
