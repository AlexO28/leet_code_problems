# You are given an array of integers nums of length n.
# The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.
# You need to divide nums into 3 disjoint contiguous subarrays.
# Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        summa = nums[0]
        nums = nums[1:]
        nums.sort()
        return summa + nums[0] + nums[1]
